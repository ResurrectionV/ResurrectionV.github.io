About Me
======
I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, working as a graduate research assistant in the [ARCADE Lab](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/) advised by Prof. Mathias Unberath. My research focuses on **multimodal visual reasoning**, where I build frameworks that combine large language models (LLMs) and foundation vision models for reasoning visual tasks, such as image/video segmentation, summarization, editing, etc.  

Before joining Johns Hopkins, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Statistics, and Mathematics at Rutgers Universityâ€“New Brunswick and pursued graduate coursework in Computing and Data Science at Boston University. I have also conducted research in **natural language processing, generative models, and multimodal AI**, collaborating with Prof. Michael LuValle and Prof. Ahmed Elgammal.  

My recent work has been published at **ICCV(oral), MICCAI, and MedAGI(oral)**  and includes building benchmarks and agent-based frameworks for reasoning visual tasks.
