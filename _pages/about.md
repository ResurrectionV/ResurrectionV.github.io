This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About Me
======

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, working as a graduate research assistant in the [ARCADE Lab](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/) advised by Prof. Mathias Unberath. My research focuses on **multimodal visual reasoning**, where I build frameworks that combine large language models (LLMs) and foundation vision models for reasoning visual tasks, such as image/video segmentation, summarization, editing, etc.  

Before joining Johns Hopkins, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Statistics, and Mathematics at Rutgers University–New Brunswick and pursued graduate coursework in Computing and Data Science at Boston University. I have also conducted research in **natural language processing, generative models, and multimodal AI**, collaborating with Prof. Michael LuValle and Prof. Ahmed Elgammal.  

My recent work has been published at **ICCV(oral), MICCAI, and MedAGI(oral)**  and includes building benchmarks and agent-based frameworks for reasoning visual tasks.  

**Research Keywords:** Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Visual Reasoning, Digital Twins, Multimodality, Generative Models, Natural Language Processing, LLM Math Reasoning
